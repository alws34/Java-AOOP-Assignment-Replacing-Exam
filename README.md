# RupCS Java AOOP Final Assignment
This project is our final project for the Java AOOP course.

In this project, we demonstrate the knoledge learned during the course by creating a night club managememnt system (basically a DB for the club's clubbers).
The system can differ between a regular clubber, a student or a soldier.
you can add a new clubber and search a clubber in order to change it's saved data.
